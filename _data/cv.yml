    - My current research focuses on gravitational waves astrophysics.
    The objective is to unravel physics buried within the data, include but 
    not limited to: finite size effects of neutron stars (tidal effect, spin
    induced quadrupole moment, QNMs, etc.), any other potential effects 
    within Einstein general relativity and beyond theories, merger rates and 
    formation channels of compact objects (stellar mass and Extreme Mass Ratio 
    Inspirals (EMRIs)), implementations of gravitational waves in measuring 
    Hubble parameter, dark mattera and dark energy in the consmology.
