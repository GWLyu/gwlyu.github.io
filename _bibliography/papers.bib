      abstract={Recent gravitational wave observations allow us to probe gravity in the strong and dynamical field regime. In this paper, we focus on testing Einstein-dilation Gauss-Bonnet gravity which is motivated by string theory. In particular, we use two new neutron star black hole binaries (GW200105 and GW200115). We also consider GW190814 which is consistent with both a binary black hole and a neutron star black hole binary. Adopting the leading post-Newtonian correction and carrying out a Bayesian Markov-chain Monte Carlo analyses, we derive the 90\% credible upper bound on the coupling constant of the theory as $\sqrt{\alpha_{GB}}\lesssim 1.33\,\rm km$, whose consistency is checked with an independent Fisher analysis. This bound is stronger than the bound obtained in previous literature by combining selected binary black hole events in GWTC-1 and GWTC-2 catalogs. We also derive a combined bound of $\sqrt{\alpha_{GB}}\lesssim 1.18\,\rm km$ by stacking GW200105, GW200115, GW190814, and selected binary black hole events. In order to check the validity of the effect of higher post-Newtonian terms, we derive corrections to the waveform phase up to second post Newtonian order by mapping results in scalar-tensor theories to Einstein-dilation Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We find that such higher-order terms improve the bounds by $14.5\%$ for GW200105 and $6.9\%$ for GW200115 respectively. },

     abstract={Spin-induced quadrupole moments provide an important characterization of compact objects, such as black holes, neutron stars and black hole mimickers inspired by additional fields and/or modified theories of gravity.  Black holes in general relativity have a specific spin-induced quadrupole moment, with other objects potentially having differing values.  Different values of this quadrupole moment lead to modifications of the spin precession dynamics, and consequently modifications to the inspiral waveform.  Based on the spin-dynamics and the associated precessing waveform developed in our previous work, we assess the prospects of measuring spin-induced moments in various black hole, neutron star, and black-hole mimicker binaries. We focus on binaries in which at least one of the objects is in the mass-gap (similar to the $2.6 M_\odot$ object found in GW190814). We find that for generic precessing binaries, the effect of the spin-induced quadrupole moments on the precession is sensitive to the nature of the mass-gap object, i.e., whether it is  a light black hole or a massive neutron star. So that this is a good probe of the nature of these objects. For precessing black-hole mimicker binaries, this waveform also provides significantly tighter constraints on their spin-induced quadrupole moments than the previous results obtained without incorporating the precession effects of spin-induced quadrupole moments. We apply the waveform to sample events in GWTC catalogs to obtain better constraints on the spin-induced quadrupole moments, and discuss the measurement prospects for events in the O$4$ run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration.},
